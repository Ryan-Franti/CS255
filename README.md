CS255 - Sys Analysis + Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The client of the DriverPass system was a CEO and IT admin who wanted to create a system that allowed student who are perparing to get their drivers' licence to take classes, tests, and make driving reservations with authorized DriverPass drivers

What did you do particularly well?
- The organization of the system was the most fluid part of this system. The system needed to accomodate student, employees, and integrate imfomation from the DMV. The ability to accomadate all of these things needed to be planned correctly for an efficent system

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- Some of my diagrams were lacking in information. For example, I should have made it more clear that employees would have a different login than students, and that certain things would be hidden from students

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- Most of the needs revolved around reservations and IT administration. We were able to make a system that showed student and driver info, accomodations, and notes. We were also able to add a few more security options, while still allowing IT to have full access to the system with block permissions.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- going back to the planning was the biggest part of designing this system. All diagrams, layouts, and features hinged on the DriverPass interview, so it became our main source of information. In the future, I think that doing the diagrams sooner would be a major help in planning.
